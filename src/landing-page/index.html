                    Leo can be a silly goof at times, and in this personal landing page where he doesn't want to seem to narcissistic, even though he is writing in the third person about himself, and this presents a problem, since it would appear that I have friends, when in reality this is not the case.

                <br>
                <p>
                    And then text always look's really impressive when we have two paragraphs or more, it shows that we are capable of construing to sentences that convey some type of meaning.

                    Anyway, I'm bored of typing, so enjoy this fake not website, I wish Affinity would let me retrospectively add artboards...
